    "question": "How do we handle data retention as a company?",
    "response": "As a fintech company, we implement a comprehensive data retention policy aligned with regulatory requirements. Customer financial data is retained for 7 years post-account closure to comply with banking regulations. Transaction records are maintained for 5 years as per IRS requirements. KYC/AML documentation is stored for 5 years after account closure. Audit trails and security logs are retained for 7 years to meet SOC compliance. Data is encrypted at rest and in transit using AES-256 encryption. Automated data lifecycle management ensures secure deletion after retention periods expire. We maintain detailed data retention schedules for each data category and conduct quarterly compliance audits.",
